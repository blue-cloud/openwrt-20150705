Description: libburn is the library by which preformatted data get onto optical media.
It uses either /dev/sgN (e.g. on kernel 2.4 with ide-scsi) or /dev/srM or
/dev/hdX (e.g. on kernel 2.6). libburn is the foundation of our cdrecord
emulation. Its code is independent of cdrecord. Its DVD capabilities are
learned from studying the code of dvd+rw-tools and MMC-5 specs. No code but
only the pure SCSI knowledge has been taken from dvd+rw-tools, though.
